# Emacs

**WARNING**: This part is a mess. As the name implies, it's a staging area, so it needs to be organized and distributed.

When using `z` to jump to a directory, Emacs shell loses autocomplete. Enable it back with `C-M-m` or the `dirs` command

```
Particularly, I find VCâ€™s C-x v = to quickly display diffs, C-x v g to run an annotated blame with heatmap, and C-x v v (vc-next-action) to do whatever is next to do (lock/unlock/commit/merge) as simply brilliant. Between those three commands, you can do 80% of what you need to do throughout the day.
```

Use `equal` to compare symbols
Use `string=` to compare strings

| C-tab                  | -       | Cycle visibility of current section and children                      |

Example of resolving a rebase conflict:

- `fa` - fetch all remotes
- `re` - rebase elsewhere, type out the target (example,
  `origin/develop`) or use the default one.
- Enter a conflicted file and magit will turn on `smerge-mode`. Press
  `C-c ^ o` (`smerge-keep-other`) to keep other; or `C-c ^ m`
  (`smerge-keep-mine`) to keep mine; `C-c ^ n` to move to the next
  conflicting area.
- Return to magit status (what idiomatic key is it other than `C-x g`?)
- `rr` to continue rebase.
- `P-Fp` pushes to the default upstream.

When browsing the log you can open a specific revision of a file with `magit-find-file`. Not sure how to do that from the diff screen.

Clojure editing tips:

- Suppose you typed the following at the REPL: `(cons [1 2] 3)`. Then you realize the arguments are in the wrong order. Place the cursor at `3`, then press `C-M-t` to swap the arguments.
- `cider-undef` to undefine variables.
- `cider-ns-reload` should theoretically reload the namespace and get rid of old references.
- Press `,` on the REPL to access the REPL menu.

## Text editing tricks

How to wrap code with code, the manual way:

- Type out the top line, `C-SPC C-SPC` to set mark.
- Move to the end of the code block (maybe `C-M-n`, `C-n`, etc)
- Type out the bottom line, `C-M-\` to indent region.

How to replace spaces with blank lines:

```elisp
["foo" "bar" "bat]
```

- Select the vector
- `M-%`
- Enter a blank space
- `C-q C-j` to enter a newline

## Search and replace

### Dired search and replace

- Jump to dired
- Run `find-grep-dired` and type out the search pattern.
- Mark the files you want to run the replacement: `t`, `m`, `u` to unmark, etc.
- Press `Q` and type out the search/replacement pattern.
- Press `Y` to replace in all files, `!` to replace all occurrences of the current file, etc.
- `C-x s` runs `save-some-buffers`. Press `!` to confirm saving all files.
- Alternatively, open `ibuffer`, mark unsaved files with `*u`, `S` to save all files and `D` to close all of them.

The easiest alternative is to run `C-c p r`, `projectile-replace`.

### Search and replace tips

- `\&` is a back reference to the entire search match in Query replace regexp.
- `\#&` is the same back reference coerced to integer. `\#1`, `\#2`
  are back references of groups also coerced to integer.

Reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/2lq0ps/equivalent_of_vims_g_command/

## Point and mark

- Mark is is a buffer location that you set.
- Point is where your cursor is at.
- Region is the space between the mark and the point.
- A region can be activated or not (`C-space`).
- Some commands do set the mark automatically, for example:
  - `beginning-of-buffer`
  - `end-of-buffer`
  - `isearch`
- About [`transient-mark-mode`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Disabled-Transient-Mark.html#Disabled-Transient-Mark):
  - Setting the mark does not highlight the region.
  - Temporarily enable mark with `C-SPC C-SPC`.
  - Some commands operate from point to the end of the buffer, and not on the region - example, `M-%`.

## Aligning

There are "native" functions to perform aligning in `align.el`. The following Ruby shortcuts (or some of them at least) can be useful:

https://gist.github.com/WaYdotNET/700416

## Better searches

- `C-c p r s` - Projectile rg
- `M-n` - Pull up the search term at point
- `C-c C-o` - Open search results in an occur buffer
- `M-g M-n`, `M-g M-p` - Navigate results

## Problems

### projectile-rails-dbconsole does not run

I found this bug but haven't tried to *definitely* fix it. The elisp
error seems to be "wrong number of arguments". Here's a dirty
fix though. Search for the following code within the
`sql-product-interactive` function, then comment out the following
line:

```elisp
(funcall (sql-get-product-feature product :sqli-comint-func)
         product
         ;; (sql-get-product-feature product :sqli-options)
         (cond
          ((null new-name)
           "*SQL*")
          ((stringp new-name)
           (if (string-prefix-p "*SQL: " new-name t)
               new-name
             (concat "*SQL: " new-name "*")))
          ((equal new-name '(4))
           (concat
            "*SQL: "
            (read-string
             "Buffer name (\"*SQL: XXX*\"; enter `XXX'): "
             sql-alternate-buffer-name)
            "*"))
          (t
           (format "*SQL: %s*" new-name)))))
```

### RSpec is dying with a strange error

- I've tried to run specs with `C-c , a`, but bundler was dying because it could not find a local gem.
- The solution was to set an environment variable pointing to the local gem: `$BUNDLE_LOCAL__MY_GEM`.

### I want to rerun the last RSpec compilation

- I you are in a project file, `C-c , r`
- If you are in the compilation window, just `g`
- If you are in neither, `M-x recompile`

### Ruby console is outputting strange characters

Check out inf-ruby documentation, "Bugs" section.

### My Emacs instance does not reponse

```sh
pkill -SIGUSR2 emacs
```

### I accidentally messed up my shell and can't find the CLI

- Go to the end of the buffer
- `comint-set-process-mark`
- `comint-clear-buffer` `C-c M-o`
- `comint-kill-input` `C-c C-u`
- `comint-send-eof`
- `comint-show-output` `C-c C-r` - Show output of last command
- `comint-write-output` `C-c C-s` - Write output of last command
- `comint-next-prompt` `C-c C-n`, `comint-previous-prompt` `C-c C-p` Go to EOL, press enter to rerun command
- `comint-kill-subjob` - Kill a hanged process
- `C-c .`, `M-1 C-c .`, etc

### I want to customize shell colors

- `customize`
- `ansi-color-names-vector`
- Choose the colors

### There is a file at my cursor and I want to access it

`M-x find-file-at-point`

### Debugging

```elisp
;; Enables debugging
(setq debug-on-error t)
```

- Or even better, `M-x toggle-debug-on-error`.
- The debugger will automatically open on errors.
- Press `e` to evaluate a lisp expression.
- Press `c` to continue.
- Press `C-h m` for help.
- Use `(debug)` to set an explicit breakpoint without having to mess
  with `(error "foo")`.

Press `C-u C-M-x` instead of just `C-M-x` to evaluate and instrument a function, so that you can use a debugger.

- Press `space` to step further.
- Press `?` for help.
- Press `q` to quit.

### To try out

- Actually read the Emacs Lisp intro. `C-h i` `m Emacs Lisp Intro`.
- ert tests.
- Use `check-parens` on save.
- `elint-current-buffer`.
- `redshank-mode` for refactoring.
- `elp-instrument-function`, call the function, run `elp-results`
- What more can `checkdoc` do?
- `elp-instrument-package` on every single function that begins with a letter. Call `elp-results` the same way.
- eless.scripter.co

### Cons cells

Represents an ordered pair: lists are built upon cons cells.

```elisp
(setq ccell '(head . tail))
(car ccell) ;; head
(cdr ccell) ;; tail
(cons 'head 'tail) ;; (head . tail)
```

### Symbols

A symbol has the following components (see symbol components in the manual):

- A name
- A value
- A function
- A property list

```elisp
(put 'h 'key 'value)
(symbol-plist 'h) ;; (key value)
(get 'h 'key) ;; value
(get 'h 'k) ;; nil

;; this is the same as using put
(setf (get 'h 'key) 'new-value)
(symbol-plist 'h) ;; (key new-value)
```

### Functions

Inline functions:

- Are faster than normal functions
- Increase the size of compiled code
- Do not behave well with debugging, tracing, and advising
- Function definition is expanded into the caller
- `defmacro` would expand into the same code, but can't be called with `apply`, `mapcar`, etc, while `defsubst` can.

```elisp
;; Both return the same results, but watch for the above details!
(defun a-number () 1)
(defsubst a-number () 1)
```

Receiving rest arguments as a list:

```elisp
(defun delegator (orig-fun &rest rest)
  (apply orig-fun rest))

(delegator (lambda (x y) (+ x y)) 1 2) ;; 3
```

And the same with optional arguments:

```elisp
(defun delegator (orig-fun &optional x y)
  (apply orig-fun `(,x ,y)))

(delegator (lambda (x y) (+ x y)) 1 2)
```

### Variables

```elisp
(defvar x 1 "a number") ;; x is 1
(defvar x 2) ;; x is still 1
(defvar y) ;; declares y

(setq z 1) ;; z is 1
(setq z 2) ;; z is 2
```

Dynamic binding:

```elisp
(setq x 1)
(defun get-x () x)

(let ((x 2)) (get-x)) ;; Returns 2
```

With `lexical-binding` the result is different:

```elisp
;; Must be declared at the first line
(setq lexical-binding t)

(setq x 1)
(defun get-x () x)

(let ((x 2)) (get-x)) ;; Returns 1
```

However, even with `lexical-binding`, things change if the variable is declared with `defvar`:

```elisp
;; Must be declared at the first line
(setq lexical-binding t)

(defvar x 1)
(defun get-x () x)

(let ((x 2)) (get-x)) ;; Returns 2
```

### General examples

```elisp
;; Printing a message
(message "prints a message")

;; Mapping over a list
(mapcar (lambda (x) (* x x)) '(1 2 3 4))

;; Use let to set up scoped bindings:
(let (x y)
  (setq x 1)
  (setq y 2)
  (+ x y)) ;; 3

;; You can also set the binding's value directly in the first form:
(let ((x 1)
      (y 2))
  (+ x y))

;; You can't reuse a binding in another binding:
(let ((x 1)
      (y (+ x 1)))
  (+ x y)) ;; error: void-variable x

;; Unless you use let*
(let* ((x 1)
      (y (+ x 1)))
  (+ x y)) ;; 3

;; You can use dolist to loop over a list
(dolist (v '("say" "these" "things"))
  (message v)) ;; nil

;; The third argument is "result", which has a default value of nil. The
;; dolist expression will always return "result" (hence the nil return value).
;;
;; dolist looks functional, but it is not. The "result" argument is only
;; useful if we use a mutable variable to update its value:
(let (reversed-list)
  (dolist (v '(1 2 3) reversed-list)
    (cons v reversed-list))) ;; nil

;; The example above will still return nil. We need to use setq to update
;; the variable's value:
(let (reversed-list)
  (dolist (v '(1 2 3) reversed-list)
    (setq reversed-list (cons v reversed-list)))) ;; '(3 2 1)

;; The message function accepts args. See the docs.
(message "%s" 1)

;; Concatenate lists by mutating them
(nconc '(1 2) '(3 4 5)) ;; (1 2 3 4 5)

;; Functional reverse
(reverse '(1 2 3 4 5))

;; Reverse in-place
(setq l '(2 2 3 4))
(nreverse l) ;; (4 3 2 2)
l ;; (2) wtf? where's the rest?
```

### Common Lisp Extensions

```elisp
;; Almost a comprehension
(cl-loop for i from 1 to 10 collect i) ;; (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)

;; Escaping out of a loop. Stops iteration at "2".
;; Justing requiring 'cl will "monkey patch" dolist to work this way.
(require 'cl)
(dolist (i '(1 2 3))
  (when (= 2 i) (return i)))
```

### Interactive functions:

Prompting for buffers:

```elisp
(defun two-b (b1 b2)
  "Select two existing buffers.
   Put them into two windows, selecting the last one."
  (interactive "bBuffer1:\nbBuffer2:")
  (delete-other-windows) ; Same as C-x 1
  (split-window (selected-window) 8) ; Splits a window setting its size to 8
  (switch-to-buffer b1)
  (other-window 1) ; Same as C-x o
  (split-window (selected-window) 8)
  (switch-to-buffer b2))
```

Prompting for numbers:

```elisp
(defun grab-a-number (n)
  (interactive "nGo Ahead: ")
  (print (concat "You gave me " (number-to-string n))))
```

### Tricks

Compilation:

```elisp
(let ((default-directory "/Users/thiagoaraujo/Code/stack/stack-development/stack-api"))
      (compile "bundle exec rspec" 'rspec-compilation-mode))
```

### Inserting a code block in org mode
